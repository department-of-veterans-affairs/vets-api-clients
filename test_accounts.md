# Sandbox Test Accounts for VA Lighthouse APIs

Lighthouse provides test accounts and data you can use to make sure your integration works as planned. These test accounts are specific to each API and login method. Both ID.me and Login.gov connect to sandbox-api.va.gov. If you use Login.gov, you’ll need an application that generates multi-factor authentication codes, such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

**Do not modify any of the attributes for these test accounts, including passwords.** If you need to use one of these accounts for a different use case, [contact us](https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us) on our developer portal.

## Logging in with ID.me

To log in to the sandbox environment using ID.me, make sure you:

  1. Choose an account that is specific to the API you want to test.
  2. Select **ID.me** to sign in to the sandbox environment.
  3. Enter the ID.me username and password. The password for all ID.me test accounts is: **Password1234!**
  4. **Don’t change any preselected answers** when asked about receiving an authentication code. Just click “Continue” to go to the next step.

## Logging in with Login.gov

To log in to the sandbox environment using Login.gov, make sure you:

  1. Choose an account that is specific to the API you want to test.
  2. Select **Login.gov** to sign in to the sandbox environment.
  3. Enter the Login.gov username and password. The password for all Login.gov test accounts is: **Password12345!!!**
  4. Use the Login.gov MFA seed to generate a 2FA code with an app such as Google Authenticator or Authy.
