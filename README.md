⚠️ **Materials in this repo may be outdated as of September 2019.** This repository contains resources for accessing VA APIs. It includes API specifications, sample clients, and general access information.   Anything older than April 2019 may be considered deprecated.  **For the most up-to-date API documentation, please visit [developer.va.gov/explore](https://developer.va.gov/explore).**

Welcome to the repository for consumers of **Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Lighthouse APIs**.  

If you would like to improve or suggest **edits to API documentation** for the VA APIs, please visit the [APIs repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) or the [Developer Portal repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/developer-portal).

Third-party access to VA Lighthouse APIs is available to anyone with a developer token (API key), which can be obtained via a [quick application form](https://developer.va.gov/apply).  Production access will be granted later by scheduling a [demo of your application](https://developer.va.gov/go-live) for stakeholders.

Note that the Health (FHIR / Argonaut) APIs for access to Veteran health records are not yet in production; dev access in sandbox using mock patient data is available, and we expect these APIs to be in production by fall of 2019.
